# NasaPOWER-Scraper-Desktop-App
A desktop application to scrape climatological data.
The Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project was initiated to improve upon the current renewable energy data set and to create new data sets from new satellite systems. The POWER project targets three user communities: (1) Renewable Energy, (2) Sustainable Buildings, and (3) Agroclimatology.
This desktop application is designed to scrape Agroclimatological data only.
--How it works--
It collects the coordinates from a csv file that has the first row as latitude and the second row as longitude.
It requires input for the time frame of the needed data.
It requires input for the agroclimatological parameters.
It requires you to click the submit button and wait until it displays a popup that reads 'All files downloaded to the folder where the .exe file is stored.'
